INSTRUCTIONS

1-) Go to your jetphys folder and backup your "settings.h" and RESULTS folder somewhere practical. So you can easily implement them to your new package

2-) Delete jetphys folder.Clone (git clone https://github.com/uur08/jetphys.git) this repo in a folder that has jecsys already... (Not inside of jecsys)

3-) Do the linking with this command  "ln -s ../jecsys/CondFormats"

4-) Finally add your "settings.h"  that was prepared for running over different ERAS... Also RESULTS folder can be added

5-) These steps should be repeated for each Run ERA until you have full 2016 DATA framework working.

5-) Add also additional readme files if you need them. Namely CHANGELOG, LXPLUS, README... (TOTALLY OPTIONAL!!!)
